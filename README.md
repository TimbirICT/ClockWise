# ClockWise

## Description
As an employee, I want to be able to clock in and out so that I can keep track of how many hours I work per week. As a group, we improved our skills with the MVC pattern. Each of us took on leadership roles in each of those folders and we worked together to debug and test the web application. We were able to gain a better understanding of Day.js, Moment.js, and TailWind for styling purposes. We worked well as a team to handle merge conflicts.
